# Meteor-split boilerplate
This is a code template for creating meteor apps. The reason I created this boilerplate is that, often, I set up 
the same directory structure within my meteor app, and it was rather tedious to do all that `mv`ing every time I
wanted to set up my project.

## Usage
This boilerplate can be cloned with [boilerplate](http://ajaymt.github.com/boilerplate).

    $ boilerplate meteor-split <project-name>

Or, you can `git clone` it.

    $ git clone http://github.com/AjayMT/meteor-split-boilerplate.git

If you do clone it manually, you'll probably have to do some renaming. After cloning the boilerplate, run it 
normally.

    $ cd <project-name> && meteor
