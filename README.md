# Meteor-split boilerplate
This is a code template for creating meteor apps. The reason I created this boilerplate is that, often, I set up 
the same directory structure within my meteor app, and it was rather tedious to do all that `mv`ing every time I
wanted to set up my project.

## Usage
This boilerplate can be cloned with [bp](http://github.com/code-boilerplates/bp).

    $ bp code-boilerplates/meteor-split my-awesome-app

Or, you can `git clone` it.

    $ git clone http://github.com/code-boilerplates/meteor-split-boilerplate.git

If you do clone it manually, you'll probably have to do some renaming. After cloning the boilerplate, run it 
normally.

    $ cd my-awesome-app && meteor
